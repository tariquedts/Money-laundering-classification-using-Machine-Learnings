# Money Laundering Classification Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

Develop a machine learning model to accurately detect **online fraudulent transactions** from a large volume of financial data, distinguishing between **legitimate** and **suspicious** activities.

## ðŸ§  Approach

- **Data Visualization**: Explored key features to understand patterns between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Sampled **500,000 transactions** for faster experimentation and modeling.
  - Handled imbalanced data to improve model performance on minority (fraudulent) class.
- **Model Building**:
  - Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Error Analysis**:
  - **Type-I Error (False Positive)**: 55 transactions wrongly flagged as fraud.
  - **Type-II Error (False Negative)**: 0 transactions missed (i.e., no fraudulent transaction was wrongly classified as legitimate).

## âœ… Conclusion

- The model achieved **100% recall** on the fraudulent transaction class.
- **Random Forest Classifier** demonstrated excellent performance in detecting fraudulent activities without missing any true fraud cases.
- Minimal false positives, ensuring limited disruption for legitimate customers.

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, model evaluation metrics)
- Jupyter Notebook
